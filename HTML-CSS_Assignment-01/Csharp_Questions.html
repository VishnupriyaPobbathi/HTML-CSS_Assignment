    <h2>Some basic questions in C#</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What is CSS?</li>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It’s a style sheet language that determines how the elements/contents in the page are looked/shown. CSS is used to develop a consistent look and feel for all the pages. CSS was developed and is maintained
            by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It was first released on December 17, 1996. The CSS Working group currently working with different browser vendors to add/enforce the new feature/ specifications in all the browsers.</p>
        <li>What are the limitations of CSS?</li>
        <p>Disadvantages of CSS are given below: Browser Compatibility: Some style selectors are supported and some are not. We have to determine which style is supported or not using the @support selector. Cross Browser issue: Some selectors behave differently
            in a different browser. There is no parent selector: Currently, Using CSS, you can’t select a parent tag.</p>
        <li>What is VH/VW (viewport height/ viewport width) in CSS?</li>
        <p>It’s a CSS unit used to measure the height and width in percentage with respect to the viewport. It is used mainly in responsive design techniques. The measure VH is equal to 1/100 of the height of the viewport. If the height of the browser is
            1000px, 1vh is equal to 10px. Similarly, if the width is 1000px, then 1 vw is equal to 10px.</p>
        <li>Difference between reset vs normalize CSS?. How do they differ?</li>
        <p>Reset CSS: CSS resets aim to remove all built-in browser styling. For example margins, paddings, font-sizes of all elements are reset to be the same. Normalize CSS: Normalize CSS aims to make built-in browser styling consistent across browsers.
            It also corrects bugs for common browser dependencies.</p>
