    <h2>Some basic questions in HTML</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What is HTML?</li>
        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a language of the World Wide Web. It is a standard text formatting language which is used to create and display pages on the Web. HTML makes the text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text
            into images, tables, links. HTML pages are saved by adding .html or .html in web page name.</p>
        <li>When are comments used in HTML?</li>
        <p>To understand the code easily, you can add code comments to your HTML document. These are not displayed in the browser, but they help you in leaving notes for yourself and other developers as to what a section of HTML is for. The start of the
            comment is denoted by
            <!– and the end is marked by — >. Anything in the middle will be completely ignored, even if it contains valid HTML.</p>
        <li>Name some common lists that are used when designing a page.</li>
        <p>There are many common lists used for design a page. You can choose any or a combination of the following list types: Ordered list – The ordered list displays elements in a numbered format. It is represented by ol tag. Unordered list – The unordered
            list displays elements in a bulleted format. It is represented by ul tag. Definition list – The definition list displays elements in definition form like in a dictionary. The dl, dt and dd tags are used to define description list.</p>
        <li>What is semantic HTML?</li>
        <p>Semantic HTML is a coding style. It is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics or meaning of the content. For example: In semantic HTML b /b tag is not used for bold statement as well as i /i tag is used for italic. Instead of these
            we use strong /strong and em /em tags.</p>
